                I'm the only child of my parents, because of the one child policy. My family
                originally was from a small village.
                Later we moved to the city area for better education. The city we lived for the past 17 years is central
                China city
                called Huanggang which is famous for its education. This a riverside city by Yangtz River bank.

                My wife's name is Kaylee. She is an elementary school teacher in an international school. She likes
                reading, especially
                classics. She likes water, basically any natural water. She is the reason why I learned how to swim even
                with hydrophobia.
                She like beach of course and now we can swim together in the ocean.

                My Dad's name is Defu Gong. He is a interior decorator who is still working,
                even some of his peers have
                already retired.
                My Mom's name is Xiudong Chen. She had worked in Coca Cola company for nearly 15 years and she is
                retired now. Right now, my mom is working as a volunteer in a retirement house with some brothers and
                sisters. She
                really enjoys the atmosphere there as it's very different from her past workplace, where people does not
                need to compete for anything.

                My parents knew each other because they were from the same area and they used
                to work together. They
                have
                been married for over 30 years. I'm thankful for my parents more and more and for more things as I
                myself
                is having more life experiences.
