            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>
                My Name is Dian Gong. You can call me Dian or Ian. I'm currently a student at <a
                    href="https://csuniv.edu">Charleston Southern University</a>.
                I'm 29 years old. I'm studying remotely from China.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have two cats, one is white and the other one is
                orange.
                Their names are Corona and Quarantia. Can you guess who is Corona and who is Quarantia
                according to the photo above?
            </p>
            <p>
                I like coding and networking. My goal is to be able to write useful modules that can be
                used with iptables, but so far I don't have any mature ideas. I also enjoy swimming and biking.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite chapter from Bible is:
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    <b>1 Corinthians 13</b> <br />
                </dt>
                <dd style="margin-right: 5%;">
                    <p>
                        <sup>1</sup> If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy
                        gong or
                        a
                        clanging cymbal. <sup>2</sup> And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and
                        all
                        knowledge, and
                        if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. <sup>3</sup> If
                        I
                        give
                        away all I
                        have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned,[a] but have not love, I gain nothing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <sup>4</sup> Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
                        <sup>5</sup>
                        or
                        rude. It does not
                        insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;[b] <sup>6</sup> it does not rejoice at
                        wrongdoing, but
                        rejoices with the truth. <sup>7</sup> Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all
                        things,
                        endures all
                        things.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <sup>8</sup> Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will
                        cease;
                        as for
                        knowledge, it will pass away. <sup>9</sup> For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
                        <sup>10</sup>
                        but when the perfect
                        comes, the partial will pass away. <sup>11</sup> When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I
                        thought
                        like a child,
                        I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. <sup>12</sup> For now we
                        see
                        in a
                        mirror
                        dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been
                        fully
                        known.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <sup>13</sup> So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is
                        love.
                    </p>
